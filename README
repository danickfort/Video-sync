Video-sync is a tool that allows to automatically create long videos out of your home made videos on your camera.
The idea is basically that you only have to put every video from one trip into one folder
and the script creates a long version of the folder content with chapters in mkv format.

It's also going to be syncing this long version with a media center.

The tool can detect new videos, updates and modification in folder content to adjust and make new long versions.

Nothing is actually working as intended for now. Don't expect it to ;)


Any comment is welcome
