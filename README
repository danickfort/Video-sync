Video-sync is a tool that allows to automatically create long videos out of your home made videos on your camera.
The idea is basically that you only have to put every video from one trip into one folder and the script does the rest.

It's also going to be syncing this long version with a media center.

The tool can detect new videos, updates and modification in folder content to adjust and make new long versions.
